The key improvements made:

1. Added proper sudo session handling to avoid timeout issues during parallel installation
2. Limited the thread pool size to prevent too many concurrent installations
3. Added better error categorization for pacman errors
4. Added proper locks for console output to prevent garbled text
5. Improved error handling with proper Result types
6. Added sudo session refresh during long installations
7. Added better type safety with proper error handling
8. Added proper console output synchronization

The Cargo.toml remains the same:

```toml
[package]
name = "package-installer"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
rayon = "1.8"
colored = "2.0"
nix = "0.27"
```

This version should be much more reliable, especially when dealing with:
- Long installation sessions
- Sudo timeout issues
- Concurrent package installations
- Error reporting
- Console output
